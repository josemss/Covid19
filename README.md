# Models for the coronavirus crisis

## SIR MODEL

I will use the same model used in this post: [Epidemiology: How
contagious is Novel Coronavirus
(2019-nCoV)](http://blog.ephorie.de/epidemiology-how-contagious-is-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov)?.
You can find all the details there and in the comments. It is a [SIR
model](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modelo_SIR).

The results should not be taken seriously since the absence of real data
makes the model inconsistent. This entry was created for informational
purposes on SIR models. I will try to update it daily. More reliable
information can be found at [IMM-UPV](https://www.imm.upv.es/covid-19/)

Daily data:
[Wikipedia](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemia_de_enfermedad_por_coronavirus_de_2020_en_Espa√±a)

Since we do not know the true data of infected people, two important
variables to take into account are the daily increase in infected and
death people.

Estimates with the SIR model:

According to this model, the rate of infection is 1.91, the height of
the pandemic will be reached by 17/04/2020.

About 6450049 people would be infected by then, which translates to
about 1193259 severe cases, about 322502 cases in need of intensive care
and up to 90301 deaths.

#### Infected forecast for tomorrow: 102000 (2020-03-30)

Previous predictions:

    21-03 -> predicted = 24896; observed = 25374; error = -1.9%
    22-03 -> predicted = 30117; observed = 28768; error =  4.5%
    23-03 -> predicted = 35272; observed = 33089; error =  6.2%
    24-03 -> predicted = 57913; observed = 39673; error = 31.5%
    25-03 -> predicted = 48440; observed = 47610; error =  1.7%
    26-03 -> predicted = 57420; observed = 56188; error =  2.1%
    27-03 -> predicted = 67868; observed = 64059; error =  5.6%
    28-03 -> predicted = 78955; observed = 72248; error =  8.5%
    29-03 -> predicted = 90661; observed = 78797; error = 13.1%

## REGRESSION MODEL

How the SIR model seems to predict worse, I use a cubic polynomial
regression model. See
[Wikipedia.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis)

The fit of the model is very good since the coefficient R<sup>2</sup> is
very close to 1.

##### Infected forecast for tomorrow (2020-03-30): 88856, with 95% prediction interval: (86144 , 91568)

##### Deaths forecast for tomorrow (2020-03-30): 7196, with 95% prediction interval: (6800 , 7591)

Previous predictions:

    Infected forecast:

    24-03 -> predicted = 38574; observed = 39673; error = -2.8%
    25-03 -> predicted = 44008; observed = 47610; error = -8.2%
    26-03 -> predicted = 51614; observed = 56188; error = -8.9%
    27-03 -> predicted = 60476; observed = 64059; error = -5.9%
    28-03 -> predicted = 69832; observed = 72248; error = -3.5%
    29-03 -> predicted = 79588; observed = 78797; error =  1.0%

    Deaths forecast:

    24-03 -> predicted = 2836; observed = 2696; error =  4.9%
    25-03 -> predicted = 3355; observed = 3434; error = -2.4%
    26-03 -> predicted = 3930; observed = 4089; error = -4.0%
    27-03 -> predicted = 4563; observed = 4858; error = -6.5%
    28-03 -> predicted = 5256; observed = 5690; error = -8.3%
    29-03 -> predicted = 6199; observed = 6528; error = -5.3%
