# Models for the coronavirus crisis

## DATA

Daily data:
[Wikipedia](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemia_de_enfermedad_por_coronavirus_de_2020_en_Espa√±a)

Since we do not know the true data of infected people, two important
variables to take into account are the daily increase in infected and
death people.

The following graph shows the differences between CC.AA. (regions) in
mortality per 10,000 inhabitants.

## SIR MODEL

I will use the same model used in this post: [Epidemiology: How
contagious is Novel Coronavirus
(2019-nCoV)](http://blog.ephorie.de/epidemiology-how-contagious-is-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov)?.
You can find all the details there and in the comments. It is a [SIR
model](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modelo_SIR).

The results should not be taken seriously since the absence of real data
makes the model inconsistent. This entry was created for informational
purposes on SIR models. I will try to update it daily. More reliable
information can be found at [IMM-UPV](https://www.imm.upv.es/covid-19/)

Estimates with the SIR model:

![](README_files/figure-gfm/SIR%20plots-1.png)<!-- -->![](README_files/figure-gfm/SIR%20plots-2.png)<!-- -->

According to this model, the rate of infection is 1.86, the height of
the pandemic will be reached by 18/04/2020.

About 6053866 people would be infected by then, which translates to
about 2905856 hospitalized cases, about 363232 cases in need of
intensive care (UCI) and up to 484309 deaths.

#### Infected forecast for tomorrow: 125311 (2020-04-01)

Previous predictions:

    21-03 -> predicted =  24896; observed = 25374; error = -1.9%
    22-03 -> predicted =  30117; observed = 28768; error =  4.5%
    23-03 -> predicted =  35272; observed = 33089; error =  6.2%
    24-03 -> predicted =  57913; observed = 39673; error = 31.5%
    25-03 -> predicted =  48440; observed = 47610; error =  1.7%
    26-03 -> predicted =  57420; observed = 56188; error =  2.1%
    27-03 -> predicted =  67868; observed = 64059; error =  5.6%
    28-03 -> predicted =  78955; observed = 72248; error =  8.5%
    29-03 -> predicted =  90661; observed = 78797; error = 13.1%
    30-03 -> predicted = 102000; observed = 85195; error = 16.5%
    31-03 -> predicted = 113106; observed = 94417; error = 16.5%

## REGRESSION MODEL

How the SIR model seems to predict worse, I use a cubic polynomial
regression model. See
[Wikipedia.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis)

The fit of the model is very good since the coefficient R<sup>2</sup> is
very close to 1.

##### Infected forecast for tomorrow (2020-04-01): 107073, with 95% prediction interval: (104001 , 110144)
